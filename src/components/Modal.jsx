            Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that is played on a 2D
            square grid. Each square (or "cell") on the grid can be either alive
            or dead, and they evolve according to the following rules:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred
                to as underpopulation).
              </li>
              <li>
                Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies
                (referred to as overpopulation).
              </li>
              <li>
                Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives,
                unchanged, to the next generation. Any dead cell with exactly
                three live neighbours comes to life.
              </li>
            </ul>
            The initial configuration of cells can be created by a human, but
            all generations thereafter are completely determined by the above
            rules. The goal of the game is to find patterns that evolve in
            interesting ways â€“ something that people have now been doing for
            over 50 years.
